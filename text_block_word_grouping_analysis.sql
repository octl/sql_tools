/* 
This code was originally used to analyze comments on customer accounts but can be adapted for any text field.
The code indexes each word in a block of text and ranks which words are used most often in conjunction with eachother.
This can help summarize and find patterns across a large set of text blocks and can be grouped by any attribute by which the text blocks are organized.
It utilizes cross joins as opposed to loops to self compare text blocks all within SQL. 
Code has been adapted from working code to pseudocode protect original confidential data architecture.

Aggregate proximity by word combinations. Calculate strength as number of instances / (average proximity/ highest proximity within analytical grouping). 
Since average is of each combination and the max is of each analytical grouping, the avg/max would give a sense of where a particular word combination stands within an analytical grouping. 
The count of number of combinations gives a sense of how often a combination occurs, so strength weights it by avg/max, so applies the distribution of proximities.
